# Omarchy-Supplement

The purpose of this repo is to hold my personal preferences for customising Omarchy to the way I like it.

### Key Justifications:
* I'm not a developer, so some of Omarchy's default applications I don't use day to day
* I like the idea of installing a setup Arch system, but want my default applied post-install
  * Removing Apps i don't use
  * Adding apps I do use
  * Tweaking some keybindings
  * Tweaking some configs

### Disclaimer:
This is a work in progress, that I'm working on gradually and learning git and new linux tools
