# Omarchy-Supplement

### Purpose:
The purpose of this repo is to hold my personal preferences for customising Omarchy to the way I like it. These will be applied to the base install of Omarchy

### Key Justifications:
* I'm not a developer, so some of Omarchy's default applications I don't use day to day
* I like the idea of installing a setup Arch system, but want my defaults applied post-install
  * Removing Apps i don't use
  * Adding apps I do use
  * Tweaking some keybindings
  * Tweaking some configs

### Instructions:
* Install omarchy
* Do a system update (using the built-in update omarchy)
* Clone this repo  
```git clone https://github.com/nzkritik/omarchy-supplement.git```   
```cd omarchy-supplement```   
* (Optional) Review the files and make changes to suit your needs
* Run the install script   
```./install-all.sh```  
* Reboot your system and enjoy
